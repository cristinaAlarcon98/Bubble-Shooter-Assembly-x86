## 🛠 Features

- 🧱 Core **Bubble Shooter** mechanics implemented
- 🎮 **Mouse input handling** to detect clicks
- 🖥️ Low-level **graphics rendering** with custom color palettes and sprite handling
- 💻 Assembly-level game logic (68k assembly)
- 🔄 Real-time map rendering and updates
- 🧠 Simple collision detection and bubble placement logic
- 🧪 Designed for **68k-based** hardware or emulator environments

## 📦 Requirements

- **68k Assembly** compiler (e.g., **Devpac**, **AS68**)
- **Emulator** for 68k-based environments (e.g., **WinUAE**, **Fusion**)
- **A system** that supports **68k-based assembly programs**
